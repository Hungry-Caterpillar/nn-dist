## How to run client
You will need 'java' to run the client.

On Windows execute:

     client.bat

On Linux execute:

     ./client.sh


## How to build
Just in case you want to build it, you would need Java JDK for the javac compiler.
It comes with pre-built class files so you probably don't need to do this.

On Windows execute:

     build.bat

On Linux execute:

     ./build.sh
